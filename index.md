Replit (also Repl.it) is a free online IDE with an active thriving (and dying) community..

## Who are we?
We are a small group of people that loved repl but, no longer do so and would reccommend people jump ship as soon as possible. We made little online web games using their as some of us didn't have nice computers to host our stuff on. We would say who we are, but we're quite afraid of repl coming after us, like they did [riju](https://intuitiveexplanations.com/tech/replit/)

## Synopsis
Replit has had many controversies such as their awful staff members, deletion and suspension of accounts for no reason, and even the possibility of them removing the domains (like Heroku).

## No more free websites?
Please note, this is **NOT** final and this is **NOT** 100% verified.

Soren (an employee at Replit) stated on 7th Feburary 2023 that projects may no longer get their repl.co domains if they are free. This means that they are restricted to an iframe on the replit.com website.

## riju.codes
What is riju? Riju is similar to [Try It Online (TIO)](https://tio.run/), just recreated by a nice bloke named Radon. Radon was bullied by Amjad Masad for "stealing the execution modes and UI"

Then threatened the poor lad with a lawsuit, even though other websites which does the same thing exist online. Amjad was deeply hurt as Radon was a "demanding" intern and he felt "betrayed". This is , by the way, since the Replit legal team has the IQ of a fish.

Of course, after being [viciously torn to shreads](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27424195) on Y Combinator, Amjad comes crawling back and setups a phone call with Radon and gives his permission to publish riju.codes because he is clearly the owner of all IDEs online and we should bow down to the holy Amjad.

## Alternatives
- [Glitch](https://glitch.com) is a nice IDE platform with a pretty chill [community](https://support.glitch.com). Plus the staff don't ban people for the tiniest reasons.
